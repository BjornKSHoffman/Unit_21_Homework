## Puppernet Crowdsale
In order to purchase PupperCoin, please upload the attached .sol contracts into your Remix and connect your metamask wallet (funded with ropsten etherium) to the ropsten test network. use "Injected Web3" to accomplish this. You will then need to compile and deploy Crowdsale.sol in the manner according to the screenshot attached: "Deploying Crowdsale.sol Instructions". You must then add the contract instance as a minter similar to screenshot example "Adding Contract Instance as a Minter". Finally, you must click on the deployed contract and look for the red button "Buy" as demonstrated in But screenshot. This will prompt you to add your Ropsten-Ether-funded account which will exchange ether for Puppercoin. Enter that address, then change the wei amount to the amount you want to buy, (This would realistically be expensive to the point of unfeasability on the real ethereum chain if buying less than ~.01 Ether worth of Puppercoin.) and click transact. Await confirmation which will look like "PUPC Created" screenshot except it will have a wei amount/cost associated. Finally, check your balance of delicious puppercoins by adding the contract instance to your 'add token' prompt on metamask. See "PUPC balance" screeenshot for success.
